  bio: >
    Hi Everyone!<br><br>
    I'm Gabriel &#128522. I currently work at Accenture as a Data Scientist Associate Manager, 
    designing and implementing digital products for the mining and financial industry. 
    I did both my masters and engineering degree at the University of Chile, under the supervision of PhD. Enrique López, 
    working on applying state of the art deep learning models to prognosis and health management problems. 
    Check out my research! <br><br>
